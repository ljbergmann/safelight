// Safelight's copy of what RAWmakase's `src/app/develop/before_after.rs`
// (upstream at ea3d0634) does to settings, without its window code. Keep it in

//! Lightroom's Before/After settings: what Before shows beside the edit, and
//! the commands that copy or swap settings between them. Before belongs to the
//! open photo and is not saved with the edit, as in Lightroom; how the two are
//! laid out on screen is the window's.
